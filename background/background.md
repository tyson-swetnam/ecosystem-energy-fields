# Background

Cellulose is made up of a long chain of sugar molecules. These chains are called 'polymers'. Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth.

The size of a cellulose polymer can vary from a few hundred to over 10,000 glucose units. This wide range makes cellulose a versatile and robuse structure for plants. Cellulose makes up the cell walls of all plants, and is the primary material in woody tissue.

??? info "Definitions"

    **cellulose** -  is a complex carbohydrate and a major structural component of plant cell walls. It is a polymer made up of glucose molecules linked together by β(1→4) glycosidic bonds. The number of glucose molecules in a cellulose chain can vary greatly depending on the source and the specific type of cellulose.
    
    **hemicellulose** -  is a heterogeneous group of polysaccharides found in plant cell walls alongside cellulose and lignin. Unlike cellulose, which is made up solely of glucose units, hemicellulose is composed of various sugar monomers, including glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, and others.
    
    **lignin** - is an organic polymer found in the cell walls of many plants, providing structural support and contributing to the rigidity of plant tissues. Unlike cellulose and hemicellulose, which are both polysaccharides composed of sugar units, lignin is not composed of glucose or any other sugar molecules.
    
    **photosynthesis** - is the process where plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and energy-rich glucose.
