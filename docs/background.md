# Background

Cellulose is made up of a long chain of sugar molecules. 

These chains are called 'polymers'. Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth.
The size of a cellulose polymer can vary from a few hundred to over 10,000 glucose units. 
This wide range makes cellulose a versatile and robuse structure for plants. 
Cellulose makes up the cell walls of all plants, and is the primary material in woody tissue.
